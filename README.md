# Data-mining-in-R
Kidney failure prediction.

Introduction & Problem definition
The goal of the project is using dataset provided by UPMC to predict patients that are at risk to progress to ESRD within 2 years, based on data mining techniques. We use R to implement XGboost algorithm to make a prediction on this problem.
